                <h1>Revolutionary dual‑chip <br> performance.</h1>
                <p>A unique dual‑chip design enables the spatial experiences on Apple Vision Pro. The powerful
                    <span>M2</span> chip
                    simultaneously runs visionOS, executes advanced computer vision algorithms, and delivers stunning
                    graphics, all with incredible efficiency. And the brand-new <span>R1</span> chip is specifically
                    dedicated to
                    process input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones, streaming images to the displays within 12
                    milliseconds — for a virtually lag-free, real-time view of the world.

                    <li>1. Testing conducted by Apple in May 2023 using preproduction Apple Vision Pro units and
                        software.
                        Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video
                        playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in
                        conjunction with an Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app.
                        Internet
                        browsing tested using 20 popular websites. FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro units
                        with
                        Personas enabled. Tested with Wi-Fi associated to a network. Battery life depends on device
                        settings, usage, network, environmental conditions, and many other factors. Battery tests are
                        conducted using specific Apple Vision Pro units; actual results may vary.</li>
